# Flow Coordinators Example
The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate how to use flow coordinators to control navigation throughout the application.

This approach assigns the responsibility of navigating through the app solely to these coordinators. It helps to solve the problem of Massive View Controller and provides a framework for more powerful and flexible routing through the app to solve for uses cases such as deep linking.
